I'm Derrick Borden and I'm a Freshman Computer Science major with minimal experience at coding
and UI/UX with the exception of some Python learning. However, I have kept all A's since my first
quarter at Drexel University and plan to keep this behavior up. I have worked one job at The Curry
Pizza Company back in my hometown where I learned to take pride in my work and succeed in times of
high-pressure situations, and I intend to keep these attributes consistent throughout my CI 102
course.
